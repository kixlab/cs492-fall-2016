	              <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                <p>This is a team-based, semester-long design project, in which you'll create an original crowdsourcing application on your own. You'll work in teams of 3-4 people. More information about each milestone will be added to this page. Here is the timeline and grading weights for each milestone:

                <ul>
                  <li>Team Formation (week 3-4): 0%</li>
                  <li>Idea (week 4): 10%</li>
                  <li>Abstract (week 6): 10%</li>
                  <li>Pitch (week 8): 20%</li>
                  <li>Prototype 1 (week 10): 10%</li>
                  <li>Prototype 2 (week 13): 10%</li>
                  <li>Final presentation (week 15): 20%</li>
                  <li>Final paper (week 16): 20%</li>
                </ul>
                
                Please note that all team members will receive the same grade for all the mliestones. 
                </p>

                <h2>Why do this?</h2>
                <p>Now that you've mastered the arts and skills of crowdsourcing, it's important that you apply what you learned to a problem you deeply care about. It's a great way to learn further, and potentially make impact.</p>

                <h2>Does my project idea qualify?</h2>
                Projects are open-ended, so please be creative. But here are some requirements: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Your project should involve a <strong> VOLUNTARY OR INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED CROWD</strong>, which means you cannot use paid crowds (e.g., MTurk, Upwork).</li>
                  <li>Your project should include some quality control or aggregation component.</li>
                  <li>Your project should have some user interface. I'm expecting most projects to be a novel crowdsourcing system that can be tested by others (e.g., a prototype website or a mobile app). Data mining or analysis focused projects are okay, but there needs to be some visualization or analytics dashboard component that is accessible by others to understand your results.</li>
                  <li>Connecting to your own research is encouraged, but please make sure to talk to us early about how to make it happen.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How do I submit?</h2>
                <p>We'll create an assignment in <a href="http://klms.kaist.ac.kr/course/view.php?id=48771">KLMS</a> for each milestone.</p>

                <!-- <h2>How do I do it well? Any tips?</h2>
                <p></p> -->

                <!-- <h2>How is it going to be graded?</h2>
                <p>
                </p> -->

                <h2>Late Policy</h2>
                <p>For each milestone deadline, all members of your team will lose 10% for each late day. Submissions will be accepted until three days after the deadline. After then you'll get 0 on that assignment. Please note that late submissions for midterm and final presentations are not allowed.</p>

                <h3>Due: 11:59pm on 9/23 (Fri)</h3>

                <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                <p>You'll need to find teammates to work on an exciting crowdsourcing project this semester. Each team should have 3-4 people.
                </p>

                <h2>How do I find teammates?</h2>
                <p>Here are three methods we provide:

                <ul>
                <li>You can use <a href="https://piazza.com/kaist.ac.kr/fall2016/cs492/home">Piazza</a> to post advertisements for finding teammates.</li>
                <li>We'll give 5 minutes at the end of two classes for in-person team formation.</li> 
                <li>Use office hours to talk to us about project ideas so that we can make connections, and you can also run into other classmates.</li>
                </ul>
                
                Please try to have diversity in your own team crowd, in terms of skillset, interest, and background.
                </p>

                <h2>How do I submit?</h2>
                <p>Please email the course staff (me and TA) with a list of your team members, including name, student ID, and email.</p>

                <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                <p>In a team, you'll identify a problem that you'd like to tackle with your project, and braimstorm <em>three distinct approaches</em> to solving the problem.

                <h3>Due: 11:59pm on 10/5 (Wed)</h3>

                <h2>What do I do?</h2>
                <p>In a team, you'll identify a problem that you'd like to tackle with your project, and brainstorm <em>three distinct approaches</em> to solving the problem.
                </p>

                <h2>Dimensions</h2>
                As we did in Assignment #2, We'll use the following seven dimensions, which were top-rated in our own crowdsourcing effort to rank the dimensions that matter the most in analyzing a crowdsourcing system.

                <ul>
                  <li>Motivation - why would a crowd worker do this? </li>
                  <li>Aggregation - how are results from multiple workers combined? </li>
                  <li>Crowd pool - you are required to use a <strong> VOLUNTARY OR INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED CROWD</strong>, but please be more specific.</li>
                  <li>Quality control - how to ensure valid results?  </li>
                  <li>Human skill - what kind of human skill is required to complete a task?</li>
                  <li>Process order - in what order is the work processed between computer, worker, and requester?</li>
                  <li>Goal visibility - how much of the overall goal of the system is visible to an individual crowd worker?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Your report</h2>
                <p>In your report, please answer the following questions:
                <ol>
                  <li>What is the problem your team is trying to solve? (one sentence)</li>
                  <li>How do we know this problem exists? Why is this problem important? Include both (1) external references (e.g., academic papers, news articles, or published surveys), as well as (2) internal investigation (e.g., results from making observations, personal experiences, or interviews with target requesters or workers). (one paragraph maximum)</li>
                  <li>Why use crowdsourcing for the problem? Why not use machines or a small group of experts?</li>
                  <li>For the identified problem, discuss with your teammates what specific challenges exist. State these challenges as <strong>"How might we..."</strong> questions. For example, for <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=985733">the ESP game</a>, questions might include <em>"How might we make the game fun so that people play multiple sessions?"</em>, <em>"How might we ensure that there is always a partner for any player at any given time?"</em>, and <em>"How might we encourage players to type in accurate labels?"</em>. List at least 10 "How might we..." questions for your problem based on the team brainstorming. <br/><strong>NOTE</strong>: Refer to Stanford's <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/HMW-METHODCARD.pdf">d.school guide</a> on "How might we" questions. </li>
                  <li>In your team, discuss how you might address these questions with crowdsourcing. Then pick the three most promising solutions overall. These solutions need to be rough and diverse at this point. For each idea, answer the following:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What is the one-sentence summary of the idea?</li>
                      <li>Describe a scenario from the requester's point of view. Think how an imaginary requester might use the system. How do they create a task? How do they review results and successfully end the task? <br/><strong>NOTE</strong>: "A scenario is a concrete, realistic story that sets up a situation involving a user with a goal to satisfy, and then follows the user through the tasks they do to satisfy that goal." (from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.813/www/sp16/assignments/gr2-designs/">MIT's 6.813 description</a>)</li>
                      <li>Describe a scenario from the worker's point of view. Think how an imaginary crowd worker might use the system. How do they come into the system? What is the task experience like? What motivates them to keep contributing? <br/><strong>NOTE</strong>: You can merge the earlier question and this one if you want to design an organic workflow, in which there's no clear distinction between requesters and workers.</li>
                      <li>Analyze the idea using the seven dimensions above. Make sure your team's three ideas have clear differences in some dimensions.</li>
                      <!-- <li>Include a hand-drawn sketch describing the idea. It can be a storyboard of , a workflow you're considering, or a rough sketch of the user interface. Basically something visual that illustrates your idea.</li> -->
                    </ul>
                </ol>
