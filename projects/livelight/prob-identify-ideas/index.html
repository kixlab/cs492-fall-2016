<h2 id="what-is-the-problem-your-team-is-trying-to-solve">What is the problem your team is trying to solve?</h2>
<p>Unlike that of text documents, the contents of videos are not easily searchable.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-know-this-problem-exists-why-is-this-problem-important">How do we know this problem exists? Why is this problem important?</h2>
<p>Online learning platforms such as MOOCs contain several videos on a topic. These videos are often long and contain a variety of topics/ideas/concepts. If there is a topic we want to find among those videos, we find it is very difficult because these concepts are not searchable and cannot be directly accessed by typing a keyword. Even when you find the right video, finding topics of your interest within the video involves skimming timeline and thumbnails. This is very time-consuming and frustrating experience for a learner trying to find a particular information. By providing ways to search videos with their indexes based on time-series tags, we want to present a much easier way to find the very information from a massive number of videos. Movida Labs <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a platform to index a video, extract people, places, organizations, keywords, and locations etc. Pavel et. al presented Video Digests <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, which makes it easy to browse and skim contents of informational videos by segmenting them into chapters. Crowdy <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> by Weir et. al involves learners to generate subgoals for how to videos and finally there <a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> is another approach in the existing literature to index videos.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-crowdsourcing-for-the-problem">Why use crowdsourcing for the problem?</h2>
<p>There exist thousands of videos online and using automated approach would not only be costly but error prone also. To deal with these videos online, group of experts would be extremely expensive, time-costing and not scalable. Also, machine algorithm is not that improved to control this type of tasks as they require comprehensive and detailed speech/image recognition. There are thousands of online-video watchers, they have detailed and sensitive speech/image recognition as well as scalability. We intend to use these watchers to generate our content.</p>
