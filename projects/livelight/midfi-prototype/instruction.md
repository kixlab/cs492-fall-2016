## Milestone 5 - Mid-Fi Prototype

### What is LiveLight
As the name suggests, LiveLight (Live stream + Highlights) is a prototype system that genrates highlights for live stream videos.

The LiveLight prototype system has the following two interfaces:

1. Crowd genrated individual moments
1. Final highlights videos

## Instructions for LiveLight

#### Adding the moments you love (1st Interface)
1. Before you use our system, you must **signup and then sign in**.
2. After you are successfully logged in to our Livelight prototype system, you will see the 1st interface as shown in the image below.

1. You can submit the 'moments you love' by pressing the button on right side of the playing video.
2. As you click on the button, a marker will apprear on playing video timeline.

### What's not working now

1. In fact, 'the novel heuristic algorithm' doesn't work yet. Those highlights you see in the 2nd interface are only thumbnail images.
1. Currently the video is recorded. It is not live.
1. Also, we don't have the feature of showing live chat, and finding new livestream videos.
