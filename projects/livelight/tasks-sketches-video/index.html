<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<h3 id="task-1">Task 1</h3>
<p>Mr. Chulbul, a 24-year-old student at KAIST loves watching NBA. Nature calls and he has to leave for the washroom. Upon coming back he realizes that he has missed a very important goal by Steph Curry. Also, he wants a highlight video for only Steph Curry after the game.</p>
<h4 id="design-goals">Design goals</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The key moments in the video should be visually highlighted, so Chulbul can rewatch missed important moments.</li>
<li>The highlight video should be produced right after the end of the game.</li>
<li>Control over share/not to share. The annotation should be shared somehow to build the public database. On the other hand, for privacy, some video annotations should not be shared.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task-2">Task 2</h3>
<p>Song Hana is a 19-year-old popular Twitch streamer. She plays a video game called Overwatch every day about 5 hours. Her gameplay is livestreamed and she wants to upload the cut of the live stream to Youtube instead of uploading the entire video.</p>
<h4 id="design-goals-1">Design goals</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A lot of Youtube uploaders cut their videos instead of updating the entire videos. Therefore, the annotations made for the live stream should be reused for the edited cut.</li>
<li>She wants to promote her videos by making them more discoverable. Therefore, her videos should be searched with the annotations.</li>
<li>As she has a lot of followers, the fans are likely to give a huge amount of annotations. Proper strategies to mediate those massive amounts of contributions should be prepared.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task-3">Task 3</h3>
<p>National Debate: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton just finished a live debate. CNNâ€™s data analyst Mark Choi wants to show the world which comments of Trump made voters angry.</p>
<h4 id="design-goals-2">Design goals</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Mark Choi wants that system should show moments of Donald sorted by the number of dislikes.</li>
<li>The system should visualize the emotional distribution of the public for each moment from the video.</li>
<li>The system should also show top three parts of the video liked by the public.</li>
