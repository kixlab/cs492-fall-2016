<h3 id="what-is-papergalaxy">What is PaperGalaxy?</h3>
<p>Understanding how each research paper is connected to each other is very important for researchers and students for them guide themselves in the wide world of science . PAPERGALAXY aims to create a semantic network of academic papers that represents how papers are related to one another.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-users-do-with-papergalaxy">What do users do with PAPERGALAXY?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Users can be guided in his/her paper finding process through PAPERGALAXY.</li>
<li>Crowds voluntarily connect papers.</li>
<li>Authors add their paper on the platform and make connections to other papers.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="who-is-behind-papergalaxy">Who is behind PaperGalaxy?</h3>
