##TEAM KIMJOSUN
###Tasks, Sketches, and Video
#####Task 1
Hyunsung, a fresh graduate student, wants to focus his study on learnersourcing. He wants to read papers in related fields for background research, so his advisor recommended him a popular paper, ToolScape, by Juho Kim. After reading the paper, Hyunsung now wants to read more papers on studies that use similar workflow design. She tries to find the papers online, but Googling doesn’t help. She wants an easily accessible platform that can guide her through her paper finding process.

- The system visualizes categorical reference relationships among academic papers.
- The system provides a platform for workers to easily categorize references.
- The system automates reference link building based on the reference section of each paper so that worker only has to categorize the existing references and add a new link if it was missed out.

#####Task 2
Hoon, professor in KAIST, has recently published a paper in CHI about crowdsourcing. His work was inspired by previous work of Bigham’s paper on VizWiz and Juho thinks he greatly improved the performance of VizWiz with his novel crowdsourcing paradigm. He wants to advertise in which way his research has improved crowdsourcing in general so that other researchers can recognize his work and do research based on his work. He posts his paper on our research map and explains how his paper is influenced by other works.

- The system supports the addition of new paper and its relation to existing papers.
- The system visualizes how and how much a certain paper had an impact and influenced other paper.
- The system provides quality control mechanism where crowds can verify whether the new paper and its relation to existing papers are added in a correct manner.

#####Task3
Juho, a senior undergraduate student who studies Physics, has a weird interest. He loves Niels Bohr so much. He wears Bohr’s costume and reads his papers every morning. One day, he found a website that shows relations between papers. It also provides an influence point of an author by automatically analyzing the relations. He realized that Bohr has lower influence than recent researchers. Users of website usually ignore old papers because they don’t reference long ago papers like Bohr’s. Juho was so furious that he started to connect Bohr’s paper to related papers. He was finally relieved after Bohr became the most influential researcher.

- The system shows an influence point of authors to encourage crowds to add relations.
- The system gives a point to crowds when they connect new relations.
- The system provides rich visualizations and search functions for crowds to identify which authors are alienated.
