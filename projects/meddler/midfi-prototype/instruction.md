## Prototype Description

##### The application which you will use through the prototype is called 1-Day-N-Questions (1DNQ), which is the crowdsourcing platform for the English learners, especially who want to be stimulated to study. My team thought about the way to let English learners to get inspired in English study, with the use of smart devices, which most of people daily hold on. For the inspiration task, we get an idea from offline English study groups. Thus, 1DNQ let learners to be clusted into a study group, and to let group members to share learning experiences to other members by making quizzes through the application. Then the application stores and sends the questions to other members, letting them to solve and evaluate the questions. In addition, all these data is stored and analyzed to help the learners to check their own English skills.

#### Therefore, in the user study experiment, please give us feedbacks on following two tasks:

----

## Task 1. Making a word note

### Link of the prototype: [https://marvelapp.com/159c7g9](https://marvelapp.com/159c7g9)

#### Instructions for task 1

- First task is to make a word note with an application. Broadly, the way to make a word note in the application resembles to the way to make a quiz to other people. 
- At first, you should choose a type of an English vocabulary (in the prototype, it is fixed to "WORD").
- Second, type a question on the application (in the prototype, it is fixed to "IMMIGRATION").
- Third, type possible answers on the blank (in the prototype, sample answers are given by a prototype).
- Next, type possible tags which can characterize the word or the phrase in the question (in the prototype, sample tags are already given).
- Then, type hints if you want (in the prototype, same hints are already given).
- You need to also set the time limit of the question.
- At last, type "OK" button to finish the task.

- Although most of tasks are done automatically, please imagine that you are doing the task manually.
- Please do given instructions while you read any English textbook.
- You can give any kind of feedbacks from very small details such as a name of a button in the application, to a very broad concept.
- Do this task in 15 minutes. 

#### Survey for task 1

- How the application is easy to use: 1(very hard) to 5(very easy)
 + Why do you think so?
- How the application seems to effective for learning: 1(useless) to 5(very useful)
 + Why do you think so?
- How the application is inconvenient to use: 1(very convenient) to 5(very inconvenient)
 + Why do you think so?

## Task 2. Solving a question & Checking study history

### Link of the prototype: [https://marvelapp.com/125i8fc](https://marvelapp.com/125i8fc)

#### Instructions for task 2

- Second task is to solve a given question of the application, and evaluate it. A question is given to the users by a push alarm (In the prototype, no buzz or sound will be given to an alarm. There will be only a tab announcement with small icon on the upper sidebar).
- You should do this task while doing other works. When you get an alarm, you check the alarm and clicking the alarm will let you get into the application automatically.
- When you get into the quiz, you can type a possible answer of the quiz. You have to solve the question in limited time suggested, then click check button to see an answer (In the prototype, answer will be automatically given).
- After see the answer, you should check whether you are right or wrong, and click right or wrong button according to your answer status (In the prototype, as wrong answer was given, you should check "wrong" button).
- After solving a question and checking rightness, you can
 + Push "QUIT" button to end the application, or
 + Push "Goto 1DNQ App" button to check study status of yourself. In this menu you can check:
	 -	Your study records, including a list of English vocabulary you learned through the application and your English skill status on each type of vocabulary, by using MyStudy menu
	 -	Control study groups you are now in, by using Study group menu, or
	 -	You can quit the application using the sign out button
- In prototype, you can get a push alarm after quit the application and be in background screen. Thus, after using the application, please push QUIT or sign out button to end the application.

- Similar to task 1, although most of tasks are done automatically, please imagine that you are doing the task manually.
- This task will be held ***two times*** in different situation: first situation is when you study an English, and second situation is when you see a video on the Youtube. You can use any English textbook, and any video on the Youtube.
- You can give any kind of feedbacks from very small details such as a name of a button in the application, to a very broad concept.
- Do this task in ***10 minutes for each situation***. 

#### Survey for task 2

- How the application is easy to use: 1(very hard) to 5(very easy)
 + Why do you think so?
- How the application seems to effective for learning: 1(useless) to 5(very useful)
 + Why do you think so?
- How the application is inconvenient to use: 1(very convenient) to 5(very inconvenient)
 + Why do you think so?
