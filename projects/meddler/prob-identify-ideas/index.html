<li><strong>Problem</strong>: Unfair and ineffective environment for learning and education</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Fair opportunity of effective education using crowdsourcing</li>

<ul>
<li>Unfair opportunity and environment can lead to the difference in the level of education.</li>
<li>Purchasing learning materials and registering courses have costs.</li>
<li>Existing learning materials are tedious for continuing study.</li>
<li>Fixed question (problem) pools of usual textbooks, workbooks, online-learning services have limitations in diversity and creativity.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>According to the survey of <em>Statistical Office of Korea</em></li>
<li>Private education costs increase as household income increases.</li>
<li>Regional differences cause differntials of private education costs.</li>

<ul>
<li>Based on our personal experience,</li>
<li><em>&quot;When I was a tutor for children, I could observe that there are a lot of difficulties for <strong>underperivileged students to study equally</strong> with other students.&quot;</em> (Sunggeun Ahn, 2008)</li>
<li><em>&quot;There are many people who want to learn new things at a later age than others. For example, my parents want to study Chinese or English, or some elderly people can start learning programming. However, if they <strong>missed the right time to get the education</strong>, the way to study has a high entrance level (or barrier).&quot;</em> (Sungjae, Young-Min)</li>

<ul>
<li>A requester uses a smart device to login to the platform.</li>
<li>When a requester logs-in, he or she needs to choose the best translation from the given translations of a certain English sentence, which is one of other requests in the platform.</li>
<li>Choice of the sentence is based on the number of evaluations; if the request on the sentence was given a long time ago and small amount of evaluations are done, the sentence is more likely to be shown.</li>
<li>In the validation phase, a requester can ‘Report’ translation for malign action and duplication. If the number of reports come to the certain translation, it will be deleted.</li>
<li>After log-in, a requester can push ‘Create’ button to submit a new sentence to be translated. He or she can choose a duration of the request, maximum to 2~3 days.</li>
