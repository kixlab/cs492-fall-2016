<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Project Summary</em></strong>* (maximum three sentences): (1) the problem you're addressing, (2) what your solution is, (3) what unique approach you're taking in your solution (how it's different from other similar solutions). This information will also go into the project gallery.*</p>
<ul>
<li>LetStory is a crowdsourced content creation tool promoting writing with a cause. In this application we demonstrate our concept of collect/create/vote, that produces diverse and media rich stories from crowd.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Instruction</em></strong><em>: Give a quick tour of the interface, and also show off some of the highlights of the interface.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Application does offer a set of two basic interfaces offered to requesters and workers respectively. This interface is being chosen by a user while logging into the platform.</p></li>
<li><p>The first step is hence, to register, the registration, does require the user to state desired username, email used, password (minimum length of 6 character) and submit by pressing the submit button</p></li>
<li><p>The user is then redirected to a informative page, where we explain who is the requester and who worker and explains how to use a respective interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Right after these acknowledgements, user is expected to login into the system with a role of the convenience, the login form, does offer the option to pick the role, using a selection box.</p></li>
<li><p>If logged as a requester</p>
<ul>
<li>The main dashboard that user sees has an option to see stories, that the requester already requested and an option to launch another new one.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If logged as a worker</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The main dashboard shows cards of stories that are currently awaiting contributions. Worker sees, which stages of collect/create/vote are available and can pick the story based on either the activity needed or the name and description of all drafts of stories.</p></li>
<li><p>The detail of the story is the main interface, where the worker can contribute. The worker can either upload new materials, or add new paragraphs or vote on paragraphs of other workers. The worker can leave the story, transiting to a dashboard, should the contribution of worker be over, or, just to let the worker explore more stories.</p></li>
