### Problem Statement
- Researchers face difficulties in reading scientific papers of unfamiliar fields with a good level of understanding.




### Tasks
- Highlight important bits of text with different colors while reading a paper (not implemented yet)
- Formulate one-sentence summary for each paragraph
- (Please check the attached video to see overall workflow including highlighting)




### Instructions   
- Since our system is not available online yet, and also it needs complex set up process to run in local, we provide you some GUI concept video of our program.
- The video was taken during the low-fi user study step, which is actually controlled by a reader who is new to this system.
- Below is the instruction we ordered to the user. Some tasks such as pros/cons are removed from our design, so you don't need to pay attention to this.
-If you want to check actual web page designs we used, you might want to look in HTML folder in our submission.
