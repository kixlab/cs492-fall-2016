## Project Summary 
* Researchers usually face difficulties in reading scientific papers of unfamiliar fields with a good level of understanding. We introduce a co-reading platform ‘Let’sRead’ where readers naturally share their reading traces which are aggregated into a helpful visual guide for efficient reading flow. Different from any other highlighting tools, it dynamically update the status of highlights according to weights made in real time by readers. 




## Introduction
* Sign-in to start reading
* Or log-in to load an individual reading log 
* Check updated readers’ trace on a paper in real time
* Highlight important bits of text and make your own trace
