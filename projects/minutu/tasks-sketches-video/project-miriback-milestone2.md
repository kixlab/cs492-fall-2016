## Abstract
Our project is about finding feedback from students to improve the learning process. We think that students should be able to send feedback about specific topics to improve the learning process. Students and instructors can cooperate to make the learning process more meaningful and motivating. Day by day, topic by topic, if needed, student by student. Every student has different constructs for building new knowledge.
We think that feedback should be easy to deliver, some existing platforms create a lot of hassle to create Q&A spaces for collaboration. Upvoting, downvoting, selecting an emotion for an anonymous (masked) comment should be allowed. From your phone, in less than 30 seconds. In class, we have noticed that students seem to express their real emotions through anonymous participation. Getting precise and honest feedback is the best way to deliver them the best materials, examples, discussions and reflections.

## Story I
Alan, a second-grade student, is taking Calculus class. After the class professor usually asks students for the feedback to improve the classes, but Alan usually keeps silence and doesn’t have a lot of stuff to say. However, some time later when he is thinking about the class, preparing for the quizzes and doing the homework he finds out that he can suggest some ideas to the professor which will enhance the course. In addition, after researching the class’ topic more thoroughly he understands that there are some parts which need more detailed explanation whereas some easy concepts are explained in a too detailed way. So, Alan needs a way to give his feedback about the class after some time has passed. Of course, he can send an email to the professor, but he thinks that the professors from other universities might find the feedback useful too. To share a plural different point of view to the class.

### Requirements:
- It is possible to add a feedback anytime, not just right after the class.
- The database with the feedback will let know the professor and instructors about the motivation for learning.
- The topics and courses are effectively merged with student’s feedback with questions and learning emotions.
- Professors can find more meaningful activities to enhance the learning process.
