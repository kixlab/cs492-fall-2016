<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>This is an application targeted at learners who want to improve their vocabulary.</p></li>
<li><p>Clicking &quot;Get started&quot; will directly start a new learning session for English words that appear in the GRE, a standardized test. In the finished application, learners can choose from different sets, and will also receive additional onboarding instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>As a learner, you will now study a number of flash cards.</p></li>
<li><p>When you finish learning a card, you will encounter a microtask prompting you for some form of response. Please do these tasks to the best of your knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Progress is currently not saved. In the future, users will be asked to login to be able to track their progress. One study session currently consists of 10 words. In the next session, users would get 10 new words. Responses to microtasks will affect the presentation of flash card contents.</p></li>
