# Quality Control review (5 mins)

# Reputation System (10 mins)


# Activity (10 mins)
- present a few different scenarios and think about what the best quality control mechanism might be
- when there's a community: maybe reputaion, etc.
- when more one-time comers are there: maybe more quantitative


# Bias (5-10 mins)

===

# Notes
- replace with the "Quality Management on Amazon Mechanical Turk" paper.

- the drawing game worked really well.
	- fun, realtime exercise that illustrates why we need quality control and also a segue to realtime crowdsourcing and crowd agents

- the activity was okay but not really insightful.
	- the part about location-based search engine had some interesting notes, such as "keeping track of where the tasks were complete can help requesters understand where the worker mostly stays, and also filter out cases where unreasonable locations are reported (Seoul - Daejeon in 30 mins)"

- cover EM algorithm in more depth?

- game theory?
