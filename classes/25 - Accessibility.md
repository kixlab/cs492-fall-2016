# Notes
- The rapid example ivnestigation activity worked quite well

- As a general technique, give students activity before going through the material,
so that they have some hands-on context, and then go over the examples at my pace.
Then ask each group to contribute bits of information (e.g., what is Vizwiz trying to solve?)

- As a general technique, it's good to ask a subset of what people did rather than
going through the entire answer list.
	- curation means more high quality content will be shared with the entire class
	- student responses to the entire class can become boring fast
	- my curation, intervention works well
