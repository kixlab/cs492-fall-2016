# Drawing Game Reflections (15 mins)
- why did it fail, even after having no trolls?
- what quality control mechanisms would have been possible?
- list a bunch of possible directions, focus on novel insights and answers.

- show the Sheep Market and other crowdsourced art projects
	- why did they work?

There were three rules to the artwork:
1. Each square cost $1 on Kickstarter. Anyone could buy a square and dictate to the artist what would be drawn there.
2. People could reserve as many squares as they liked.
3. Anyone could ask for anything to be drawn. Anything.

# Legion (5 mins)

# Twitch Plays Pokemon (5 mins)
- YouTube video to illustrate what it's about

# Notes
The drawing game reflection + design activity worked quite well
- students have experienced the game themselves, so their comments were more to the point and concretely useful.

Crowd agent intro felt quite strong.
