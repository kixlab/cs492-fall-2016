# Integrated / Organic Crowdsourcing
- properties from my AAAI slides

Will this be relevant in 5 years?
- ESP Game, ReCAPTCHA: no
- Good AI eventuially replaces the crowd

What's not replaceable?
- Something that's extremely difficult... but it's just a matter of time.
- Something that's organic? Providing intrinsic motivation?
	- no need to replace crowds, because crowds benefit from the work and it's important part of the workflow.
