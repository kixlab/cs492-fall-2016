Respect for person
- not quite informed consent
- deception
- Making participant even more stressed 
- User should be in control, clearly not
- User can stop at any time
- No reason to have 2 people in the same room
 
Beneficience 
- Not “do no harm”
- Risk vs benefit to society NOT right

Justice
- Not Fair

# Notes
- Too much conceptual stuff, got boring toward the end
- Really need to add in the "analyze existing paper for their experimental approach" activity
