06 - Programming Paradigms Part 2

# Admin

## Reschedule 9/29 class (5 mins)
- write down a few options on the board, show of hands per option
- deadlines will stay the same, but then presenter...
- 9/28 evening

## Reading Response Examples & Feedback (5 mins)
- show model examples, post on the web
- too much summary is not a good summary (quantity means being lazy)
- much more focus on the reflection (both positive and negative)
- ideal proportion between summary:strength:weakness = 1:1:1
- (X) "I learned [copied from paper], I think [copied from paper] is interesting."
- (V) "The paper's techniques are novel in that [your thoughts on why]."
- do not put too much detail in the summary. high-level summary is harder than including unnecessary details.
- summary: strength: weakness = 1:1:1


# Programming Paradigm (5 mins)

## Turkit vs Automan
- It's all about adding layers of abstraction in human computation

## DB + Crowds

# UI Programming Paradigm (15 mins)
- What is prototyping? Fidelity?

- Wizard of Oz (talk about it in the crowd agents class?)

- human-powered UI: Google example we talked about in the last class

From the episode, “The Pool Guy”. Kramer gets his phone number changed because of “…chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.” His number is changed to 555-3455, but this drives him even more crazy because he keeps getting wrong number calls every five minutes. Jerry deduces that 555-3455 is 555-FILK, which by itself is nothing, but 555-FILM is Moviefone, and is just one digit off from Kramer’s number. People are calling to get Moviefone and are dialing Kramer’s number by mistake. At first this annoys him, but then he decides he kind of likes “helping out” Moviefone by looking up movie showtimes for the people that are calling him. George ends up calling Moviefone and getting Kramer by mistake. Kramer instructs George in his best Moviefone voice, “Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.” George enters C-H-U for “Chunnel”, the movie he’s looking for. But of course Kramer has no idea what he pressed since he’s just on his regular home phone; he just hears the buttons being pressed. So, Kramer just guesses that George has selected “Agent Zero”, and tells him to press 1 if that is correct. When the button isn’t pushed, Kramer guesses another movie. When he’s wrong again, he just says, “Why don’t you just tell me the name of the movie you’ve selected?”


# Discussion
- Wizard of Oz: 1 person vs 1000 people
	- what advantages and disadvantages?
	- 1 person: availability of expert problematic, fatigue
	- 1000 people: coordination, conflict resolution, aggregation
- How to ensure repeatability / stability / consistency with the crowd?
	- engineered workflows, microtasks

- Many different models might be possible
	- maybe back to our hypothetical human-powered search engine startup
	- for the requester, it doesn't matter if it's one person vs 1000 people
	- they just pay for the result
	- under the hood, (1) one person does it all, (2) one "leader" in charge of producing good results, (3) some pre-determined workflow puts people to work, (4) other organizational structure possible (hierarchy, teams, FIFO one-time work, )

- What is the best model for Google-like search engine with a crowd?


## Wizard of Oz Exercise
- Let's do a Wizard of Oz activity in class
- Let's simulate technology that doesnt' exist yet. (or works terribly)
	- Detecting human's emotion and suggesting food.

- crowdsourcing as a prototyping tool
	- often useful for future technology that's not quite available yet
	- 1983 listening typewriter
	- Intelligent agent prototyping paper 



# Topic Presentation (30 mins)
No student presenter today

## Soylent (5 mins)

## CrowdForge (5 mins)

## Jabberwocky (5 mins)

## Workflow design activity (20 mins)


# Team Formation (10 mins)
- show of hands: how many people already have a team?
- are there teams that need extra members? advertise.
- are there individuals that need a team? advertise.

===

# Reflection
- workflows and paradigms should really be covered together.

- Design Activity could really work out well for this class
	- Pick a fun exmaple (human-powered Google, Personal assistant) and ask students to come up with their own workflow or a model
	- Afterthought: it worked out pretty well. Maybe more guidance / structure / constraint could be good because it was a bit too 
	- longer time for reflection and discussion would have been nice.

- Speed dating for team formation worked out pretty well.
