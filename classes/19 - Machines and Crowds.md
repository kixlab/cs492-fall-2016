# Machines and Crowds

# Admin (5 mins)

# Discussion of the activity (15 mins)
- comparison between datasets


# Today's focus
- focusing more on direct collaboration between machines and crowds
- rather than offilne data labeling + training using the pre-determined data
- also, focusing on interactive systems that leverage crowds and machines at the same time

# Human-Machine Collaboration (10 minx)
- why collaborate?
- human-machine cooperation TED talk
- advanced chess
- Monotrans
- Moravec's paradox


# Active and Passive Crowdsourcing (10 mins)


- look at Chris's lecture
- Michael and Etan's book chapter
- also, my own definition

- Passive: Google Maps, 
- Active: 


# Student presentation
- designing a human-only, machine-only workflow is a reasonable activity
- machine only
	- hardware, deployment, privacy issues
- human only

It'd be useful to discuss what techniques exist in making crowds + machines work well together.
=> dynamic handoff and sporadic checks (Zensors), giving individual benefits (AXIS), analogical reasoning (Flock)
