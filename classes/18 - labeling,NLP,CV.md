# Data Labeling, NLP, CV

# Admin (10 mins)
- Timeline of the project
- Possibility of extending to a WIP / Poster at a conference

# Data labeling in machine learning (5 mins)
- why is labeled data needed? supervised learning
- what kind of data labeling tasks exist?

## Typical tasks in CV and NLP that require extensive data collection
- visual question answering, dense captioning, activity recognition

## Why data matters.
- more data actually helps
- research contributions

# Activity (25 mins)
- Explore and analyze an image dataset (15 mins)

# Faster labeling techniques (5 mins)

- RSVP: http://ai.stanford.edu/~ranjaykrishna/rsvp/static/demo.html
- Multi-labels

# Notes
- The dataset analysis activity was quite fun. Seems to work quite well.
- Slides were overall well received.
- A bit more interactivity in the earlier part of the slides would have been great.


- comparison between hierarchical representations of tags
	- were there any meaningful differences in approaches?
	- probably doesn't really matter much for the topic. more related to workflow design and quality control.
