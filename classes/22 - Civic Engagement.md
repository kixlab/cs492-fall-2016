# Civic Engagement

# Admin (10 mins)
- project web pages available, send project descriptions
- heuristic evaluation overdue
- project deadline extended


# What is civic engagement?


# 1. Participatory democracy
- civic tech
- look at my example survey 

- maybe talk about https://pbstanford.org/
- may talk about voting?

## TED talk: Parlio CEO talk or Loomio talk

## Activity: try something out, Loomio?


# 2. Activism

# Crowdsourced fact checking
- can it work?
- give an example (reddit, Factful)

# Activity: design a crowdsourced fact checking workflow


# 3. Disaster responses and mapping

## Open Street Mapping
- humanitarian mapping, disaster response
- Voluntweeter
- ttt

# 4. Communitysourcing

# 5. Discussion

# Quality control issue
- political positions are reflected

# Successful civic engagement tools
- quality control less of an issue unless there are stakes involved
- starting to contribute to the work voluntarily is a barrier for many people
- usability of the UI
- benefit visible?

# Analyze an existing platform in terms of the important dimensions
- maybe revise the dimensions for voluntary crowdsourcing systems
- any other factors beyond what we discussed in learnersourcing?

Notes

	- had time only up to #2 of the plan.

- talking about filter bubble, echo chamber was great, resonated with students
- The Arab Spring video worked well, resonates with what's happening in Korea

- consider showing a live demo of BudgetMap
- even design a tagging activity

- Paul's budgeting activity
