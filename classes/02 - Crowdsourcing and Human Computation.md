# The Rise of Crowdsourcing
- summary
     - four examples
     - first appearance of the term crowdsourcing
- plus
     - it was already happening, but a good analysis, formal categorization, descriptive
- minus
     - outdated? 


- does this mean the end of experts?
     - what kind of experts would have a better chance of surviving?
     - for what kinds of tasks would you use the crowd?
     - expert tools are becoming cheaper and cheaper: SLR, Photoshop, micro payment system, marketplace...
          - important chunk of HCI research: tools for experts and novices
          - SETI@Home, iStockPhoto, open source, Wikipedia
     - user contributions > custom generated content by experts
          - YouTube, Afreeca TV > traditional media companies
               - PewDiePie, 대도서관, 캐리언니, 
     - AirBnb, Uber: not really professionals, but low barrier to entry
          - it was the policy and legal restrictions not necessarily the work itself
          - driving an Uber vs driving your own car for commute
               - finding customers, processing payment, optimizing for higher income is the hard part, but Uber takes care of it.
          - same logic applies to AirBnb: we clean rooms 
- MARKETPLACE business on the rise
     - people / crowd contributors provide content and user-facing service
- Stock Arists Alliance => Uber issue: basically the same logic
- “The response rate was fantastic, but almost all of them were complete crap"
     - simply having the tools won’t suffice
     - fluctuation in quality
     - how to make it consistent and reliable?

     - what can also be crowdsourced? 정치? 예산 계획? movie? research? (PolyMath, Stanford Crowd Research)

- “the strength of weak ties.” The most efficient networks are those that link to the broadest range of information, knowledge, and experience. => sociology explanation for why crowdsourcing might work

- crowdsourcing yields higher recall, lower precision
     - broader coverage, unexpected input

- "Technological advances in everything from product design software to digital video cameras are breaking down the cost barriers that once separated amateurs from professionals. Hobbyists, part-timers, and dabblers suddenly have a market for their efforts, as smart companies in industries as disparate as pharmaceuticals and television discover ways to tap the latent talent of the crowd. The labor isn’t always free, but it costs a lot less than paying traditional employees. It’s not outsourcing; it’s crowdsourcing."

- “Outsourcing is when I hire someone to perform a service and they do it and that’s the end of the relationship. That’s not much different from the way employment has worked throughout the ages. We’re talking about bringing people in from outside and involving them in this broadly creative, collaborative process. That’s a whole new paradigm.”


# Taxonomy paper
human computation:  “...a paradigm for utilizing human processing power to solve problems that computers cannot yet solve.”

- The problems fit the general paradigm of computation, and as such might someday be solvable by computers.
-  The human participation is directed by the computation system or process. (This is discussed more below.)

Whereas human computation replaces computers with humans, crowdsourcing replaces traditional human workers with members of the public.

“Crowdsourcing is the act of taking a job traditionally performed by a designated agent (usually an employee) and outsourcing it to an undefined, generally large group of people in the form of an open call.” [24]



Discussion
- why taxonomy matters
- drawbacks of a taxonomy: what does it miss?
- how to verify? completeness, correctness, accuracy





Admin
- no lecture, no exam
- active learning
- activities: quick recap of 1st class & concrete TODOs
     - reading response: how to write, grading, how to submit
     - topic presentation: my example today, grading, 
- question in Korean okay
     - I’ll translate and share with the class
- assignment #1: be a crowd work
     - pick on of the following platforms: Galaxy Zoo, eBird, Lab in the Wild, ESP game, FoldIt, Johnny Cash Project, 
     - pick 3-4 platforms and add some quantitative measures so that we can compare them
