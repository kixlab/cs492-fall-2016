05 - Programming Paradigms Part 1

# Admin (5 mins)

# Final Project (5 mins)

# Discussion of Assignment 2 (5-10 mins)

# Programming Crowds
human on chip image again

why?
- simple, mundane tasks => more complex

what do you think are important programming constructs?
- 

literally taking the metaphor forward?

what is needed for the crowd to be programmable?
- fundamental building blocks, replicable, expected
- the entire foldit every time is perhaps not replicable
- what are the functional units?

a lot of research is inspired by metaphors


# Examples
Turkit, iterative vs parallel, Automan
Quicksort?
Human DB operations

# Discussion: crowd-powred Google? (10 mins)

# Topic Presentation (30 mins)

# Team Formation (5 mins)

# Reflection
Project overview / Assignment 2 discussion took more time than I thought.

A bit too high-level
- make clear why programming paradigms and what implications it has

connect to old punch card => realtime debugging metaphor

crowdsourcing is hard to debug
- bug is difficult to replicate (even costs money)
- nondeterministic?
- cycle takes too much time to run
=> time (make it realtime),
