# Crowd after AI

The future of unpaid crowd work?


Probably a lot of mundane tasks will be taken over by machines
But that's probably okay, although we'll need a way to find alternative work her the crowd who mostly does this sort of work

What about coordination, routing, management work?
Is it okay to be replaced by the machine?
